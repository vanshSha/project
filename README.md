UserEntity Class (located in the stop.entity package):
Represents a user entity with attributes id and name.
It has constructors, getters, setters, and a toString() method for representing the user entity as a string.
Repository Class (located in the stop.repository package):

Contains methods for managing user entities.
The createUser method creates a new user with predefined values and returns it.
The printUser method prints the user's ID and name.
The updateUser method updates an existing user with the information from another user.
There's a commented-out section for updating the user in a database, which is currently replaced with updating the user entity directly.
Service Class (located in the stop.Service package):

Contains methods for performing user-related operations.
The createUser method calls the createUser method from the repository and returns the created user entity. However, the repository field is not initialized in this class, so this would lead to a null pointer exception when trying to call repository.createUser().
There are commented-out methods for updating and deleting users and for printing user details.
Controller Class (located in the stop.controller package):

The main method is the entry point of the program.
It creates instances of the Service and Repository classes.
However, the Repository instance is not used in this code, and there is no interaction with user entities.
